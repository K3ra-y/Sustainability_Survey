## Aim of the Survey

We are looking at which factors influence a person's opinion and attitudes towards the importance of sustainability.

## Survey will consist of following questions;

* How sustainable are you from 1-10 scale?

  - We will set a scaler and participants will slide and rank themselves based on self perception.

* Your age group

  - This will be binned to ensure the privacy of the participants.

* Your education major

  - Science, Health, Engineering, Arts.

* Did you grow up in environmentally conscious family?

  - Yes/No

* Do you use a reusable mug?
  -  Yes/No


 > how often they recycle, how often do you think about eating less meat, flying vs driving vs biking/walking, how do you commute to school, did your parents recycle/grow up in a environmentally conscious family, have you studied the environment or taken any sustainability courses.

 ## Other question we aim to answer

 Additionally, which factors may drive the *change* in opinion and attitudes towards the importance of sustainability.

 # Plan for analyzing the survey results

 Response variable will be set as a scale and this will allow us to have a continuous response variable. Then we will use *linear regression* to identify which  predictors (age, education major, background, habits) has an effect on the response variable.

 Analysis will be carried out in R statistical software.
